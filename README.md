Project 1 in the Udacity AWS Cloud Architect nanodegree

Create highly available solutions to common use cases. You will build a Multi-AvailabilityZone, Multi-Region database and show how to use it in multiple geographically separate AWS regions. You will also build a website hosting solution that is versioned so that any data destruction and accidents can be quickly and easily undone.
